This weight, will increase with the frequency of the connection.\nThe same is done for the nodes, if a genre appears more often the weight of the node will increase.\n\nOnce the network is created, it is possible to divide it into partitions.\nBy evaluating the wordclouds of the genre names for each partition, we can detect an overall genre or family genre\n for the partition that embraces the motive of the wordcloud and thereby detect which genre/partition an artist belongs to.\n\n Detected main genre by community: \n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_0.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_1.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_2.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_3.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_4.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_5.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_6.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_7.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/wc_gen_8.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n\nAs seen in the examples of the wordclouds above there is a clear theme in each of the wordclouds.\nThus it is possible to identify a main/family genre that comprises all genres from the community and thus label the community accordingly.\n\nThis procedure does however not guranteee that the genre of every artist will be 100% correct. \nAs the genre of an artist is based on the partitions of the network they will greatly rely on the underlying procedure of constructing the partitions.\nSome artist might also make music from different genres which is not accunted for.\nFor the purpose of our analysis the procedure applied is however needed, and the results of it should thus be assesed with this conditions in mind.\n<!-- Furthermore, it can also be discussed whether or not it is fair to reduce the amount of genres to only a handfull. -->\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-3d33c6c1-df0c-430b-bed1-871f182937de","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The final network of artists is thus made up of 3098 artists with 17155 collaborations from 8 different genres: *Pop*, *Rock*, *Alternative*, *Hip-Hop*, *Country*, *Reggae*, *Funk-Soul* and *Punk*.\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/nw_artists.png\" width=\"75%\" />\n\nThe visualization shows how the different genre types are mostly grouped together but also that some genres like the *Funk-Soul* genres is scattered around the network.\nThe node size is set accordingly to how many other artists the artist is connected to. \nIt can for example, be observed that several nodes within the *Hip-Hop* genre appears to be well connected to other artists.\nIt appears that some genres are better represented than others but it can however be difficult to extract alot of information about the network from the visualization.\nThe network is thus analysed further. \nTo begin with lets look at how the nodes are distributed between the genres.\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/number_nodes_genre.png\" width=\"75%\" />\n\nThe graph shows, as we expected, that the number of artists is very unbalanced between the 8 genres.\n*Hip-Hop* is forexample represented twice as much as *Pop*, which is something that has to be kept in mind through out the analysis.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-256c1d2e-49dd-4742-83fc-a3528d191c49","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Network Density** \n\nBy looking at the number of nodes and edges, we can obtain the graph density. \n The network of study has a low density of just 0.36, \n meaning that it has a relatively low number of edges compared to the total number of nodes.\n\n**Clustering Coefficient** \n\nTo evaluate how interconnected the nodes of the network are,\n the average clustering coefficient is calculated. With a low value of 0.122, it indicates that on average the collaborators of an artist do not necessarily collaborate between them.\n In fact, 45% of the nodes in the network collaborate with artists that do not collaborate between them. \n To understand if there is a relation with the degree, we can plot them together and analyse their correlation:\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/corr_clustcoef.png\" width=\"75%\" />\n\n There is not a clear correlation between the two (correlation coefficient = 0.11). \n However, the graph shows that the highest clustering coefficient happens at degrees below 15. \n The clustering coefficient was also examined for each genre but no significant pattern was found.\n \n**Centrality** \n\nTo measure the centrality of the graph we can use the betweenness centrality.\n It is based on the network shortest paths and captures how much a given node is in-between others. \n To understand it a bit better, we can observe the top most central artists where among we can find:\n\n| Artist        | Betw.

To start understanding how the degree behaves, \n we can assess its relation with the centrality.\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/corr_cent.png\" width=\"75%\" />\n\nThe graph shows that there is a direct and strong correlation between the two (correlation coefficient = 0.7).\nThis means that nodes with a higher degree will tend to have a higher betweenness centrality.\nTo put into the context of the network it means that if an artist collaborates with several other artists he/she will generally also be central in the network.\n\n**Degree Distribution:**\n\n With our network the degree is especially relevant since the number of collaborations\ndirectly translate to the degree of a node.\n\n<img src=\"/pictures/deg_dist.png\" width=\"75%\" />\n\nThe highly skewed histogram, resembles an exponential decay with\n high frequencies on low degrees and low frequencies for high degrees. \n When looking at the logarithmic transformation, it is possible to see how the scatter plot follows an almost straight line. By calculating the exponent $\\gamma$, we can confirm \n  the network falls in the Scale-Free regime, since $2 < \\gamma < 3$. Thus the degree and collaborations between artists follow a *power-law distribution*.\n  It is not surprising that the collaborations between artists follow a *power-law distribution*, \n one would expect that the way artists collaborate should not differ a lot from how scientist collaborate (citations network),\n which is a known *power-law* network [[ref]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myLgzbXxhOQ&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=SuneLehmann). \n \n However, to understand which characteristics the extreme nodes share, it will be interesting to add in our analysis of\n collaborations a comparison between the extreme nodes and the rest. \n To do so we can make the definition that artists that have 25 or more collaborations are categorized as Top Collaborators. \n  Marking the barrier at $degree \\geq 25$  allows us to have a sample that reaches 10% of the data.\n  Thus a sample big enough to perform comparisons, while still portraying the behaviour of the top range.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-d018b8be-bae0-4b64-b677-144aa4f6bedb","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Page 3: How do artist collaborate?\n- Introduction\n    - Show top collaborators\n- Collaborations vs. Popularity\n- Collaborations vs. Genres\n- Collaborations vs. Sentiment\n    - Explain how the sentiment is calculated\n- Collaborations vs. Time\n    - Amount of collaborations over time ðŸ“·\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-b0a5c93e-3b89-4a71-a9ad-9ad6eecd87af","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are now ready to answer the question that started this project.\n\nTo do so, we will explore the relation of collaborations with 4 different parameters:\n\n$$ \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\LARGE\n\\bold{\nPopularity \\space | \\space Genres \\space |  \\space Sentiment \\space | \\space Timeline}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEach of these parameters will be held against the level of collaborations which directly translates to the degree of the nodes of the network.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-10b71ecf-001a-4034-9ccd-2cf25945e306","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before starting it is intersting to take a look at the Top collaborators of the Network, thus the *kings and queens\nof collaborations*: \n\n**TRANSFORM THIS IN TO CARDS WITH PICTURES**\n\nTop 10 Collaborators:\n\nLil Wayne | Degree: 186 | Popularity: 92 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nGucci Mane | Degree: 186 | Popularity: 84 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nRick Ross | Degree: 172 | Popularity: 83 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nBusta Rhymes | Degree: 159 | Popularity: 80 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nT.I. | Degree: 147 | Popularity: 81 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nE-40 | Degree: 146 | Popularity: 73 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nFrench Montana | Degree: 145 | Popularity: 82 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nThe Game | Degree: 136 | Popularity: 77 | Genre: Hip-Hop\nChris Brown | Degree: 129 | Popularity: 92 | Genre: Pop\nWiz Khalifa | Degree: 126 | Popularity: 88 | Genre: Hip-Hop\n\nIf we look at the popularity of the top 10 collaborators, it is possible to see that they all have popularity higher than 73. \n\nMore interesting is that all except one artist are from the genre *Hip-Hop* and thus mainly rappers.\nWe could already make some hypothesis, will *Hip-Hop* artists be the ones that have more collaborations?

The TF is the times a word appears in a document (in our case all the lyrics of a genre) divided by the sum of the frequency of all words in the document.\nThe IDF on the other hand is focused on how

higher score.\nThe TF-IDF score is then the product of the two terms and is used to choose which 100 words are showed in the word clouds below.\n\n**INSERT THE WORDCLOUDS HERE PIETRO**\n\nFor every word cloud, there are interesting things to notice. \nHowever, we found that the best and most describing word clouds were for the *Hip-Hop*, *Country* and *Reggae*.\n\n**Hip-Hop**  \nFrom the word cloud alone it is rather clear that the genre is *Hip-Hop*.\nThe words *wiggy* (which is slang for 'emotional uncontrolled or weird'), *westside* (which could be a reference to the original westcoast rap in America) and *thang* (slang for thing) are some of the most unique words for the genre. \nThese words together with words such as *muthafuckin*, *bitchy* and *skrrt* all paint a rather clear picture of the *Hip-Hop* genre.\n\n**Country**  \nWith words such as *outback*, *hillbilly* and *tailgate* a very clear theme is showed.\nThe words in the word cloud give you the *hillbilly* feeling of being on a farm, drinking beer out of your *chevrolets* and *gunnin*.\nThe word cloud thus confirms a lot of the classical stereotypical ideas about what *Country* music is.\n\n**Reggae**  \nMost of the words in the word cloud can appear to be nonsense words, slang or sound words such as *dem*, *di*, *fi* and *inna*.\nThis is however very typical for the *Reggae* genre as it is very inspired by Ska, which originally is a Jamaican music genre. \nReggae therefore almost has its own terminology and sound words which are not used in other genres.\nThe word cloud thus paint a very good picture of some of the things *reggae* is all about.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00017-f6ff53d4-ad47-4198-8e4d-f19f59d6bdb9","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Previously we looked into how the sentiment

is less than 0.2 it is hard to assess if the difference is significant.\n\nEarlier we saw that between the saddest and the happiest artist there was about 1.0 difference in sentiment, so let's see which artists are the happiest and the saddest.\n\n**Happiest artists**\n\n| Artist                    |        Genre          | Sentiment     |\n|-------------------------  |:------------------:

is an American gospel music artist who has track names such as *Grateful* and *Amazing*, it thus makes sense that he is the happiest artist. \n The band *Crystal Fighters*, an English-Spanish band

styled electronic music it often repeats the same lyrics over and over again.\nSo if one of the chosen songs include one or several sad words this could explain his leading position on lower sentiment.\nBesides *Alvin Risk* the artists such as *MotÃ¶rhead*, *Black Label Society* and *Bone Crusher* almost just from the names explains why they are among the 10 saddest artists.\nIn particular, *Black Label Society*, which is a hard-rock and heavy-metal band, characterized by its biker aesthetic, \nwith leather jackets, combat boots and studded belts. \nSome of their latest albums include *Order of the Black (2010)* and *Catacombs of the Black Vatican(2014)*. \nThereby it is not a surprise that they appear in the saddest artists list.\n\nBelow it is further possible to

how artists collaborate, a network of 3098 musicians from 8 different genres was constructed.\nThe analysis of the network showed that overall the artists which are popular tend to do more collaborations.\nHowever, the level of collaboration also turned out to be dependant of the genre.\n*Hip-Hop* being the genre with generally the highest amount of collaborations while the lowest amount of collaboration was found among the genres *Alternative*, *Rock* and *Punk*.\n*Hip-Hop* was also found to be the genre with the highest amount of collaborations within itself.\nMeaning that *Hip-Hop* artists collaborate more together than with other artists, which was similar for *Reggae* and *Country*.\nAnd, not so surprisingly, it was also found that genres with similar characteristics tend to collaborate more, \nsuch as *Funk-Soul* and *Hip-Hop* as well as *Rock*, *Alternative* and *Country*.\n\nBy further downloading song lyrics for all artists of the network and analysing the text, more characteristics were revealed. \nOverall the saddest lyrics, accordingly to the sentiment analysis, were found to come from *Hip-Hop* artists \nwhile the happiest lyrics were associated with *Funk-Soul*.\nThis was further backed up by visualizing word clouds for each genre as these showed rather harsh words for exactly the *Hip-Hop* genre.\nTo analyse further, the year of the songs and artist were also introduced.\nThis showed that from 1960 to 2020 the sentiment had overall fallen, meaning that generally, the lyrics of songs had become sadder with time.\nBy looking at the level of collaboration and year of an artist it was found that the average amount of collaborations for an artist went from 2.5 to 20, \nbeing now eight times higher.\nMeaning newer artists generally collaborate more.\n\nAll of these results are however based on just a small subset of artists and a few of their songs.\nBy choosing different artists and including more song lyrics the results and conclusion could change accordingly.\nFurthermore, many of the conclusions are based on the genres of the artists which were constructed from the partitions of the genres network.\nThe chosen genres for every artist thus might not be always correct and the fact that artists can be in several genres is not taken into account,\n which again might influence the results.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00021-51dca131-e8fd-4f3d-b16a-6079bffb716d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"a4462334-750c-4ec3-89d6-faf2f925e61c","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
